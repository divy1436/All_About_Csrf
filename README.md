# CSRF Articles & Practice

This repository contains a collection of educational articles and practical resources focused on **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)** and other related web application vulnerabilities. It's intended to help learners, developers, and security researchers understand, identify, and mitigate CSRF attacks.

## Contents

- **Cross-Site Scripting Exploitation - Hacking Guide**  
  Explores how XSS can be used in real-world attacks and often works in tandem with CSRF vulnerabilities.

- **Comprehensive Guide on Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**  
  A detailed overview of XSS, types of XSS attacks, and exploitation techniques.

- **Understanding the CSRF Vulnerability (A Developer’s Perspective)**  
  Breaks down how CSRF attacks occur, their impact, and secure coding practices to defend against them.

- **Command Injection (DVWA Series)**  
  While not directly related to CSRF, this file provides insight into command injection using the DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application) platform.

## Who Should Use This

- **Web Developers** — to understand and prevent security flaws.
- **Security Researchers & Bug Bounty Hunters** — for quick reference and hands-on material.
- **Students & Learners** — to explore common vulnerabilities in web security.

## How to Use

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the PDF files locally for reading.
3. Practice and apply the concepts using intentionally vulnerable apps like [DVWA](http://dvwa.co.uk/), [bWAPP](http://www.itsecgames.com/), or [WebGoat](https://owasp.org/www-project-webgoat/).
